#+DESCRIPTION: Understanding Rich Hickey's vision about existing languages

Completely mind blowing video from Rich Hickey ([[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]'s creator) where he exposes the limitations of the overall mainstream languages.

I do not enter much into the details here as Rich Hikey himself is so good at explaining it.

It's not about [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]], which is the mere implementation of what this video is all about.

Be open-minded, sit back and enjoy!
