Completely mind blowing video from Rich Hickey ([[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]'s creator) where he exposes the limitations of the overall most popular actual languages.

Here's the link. I do not enter much in the details here as Rich Hikey himself is so good at explaining.

It's not about [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]], which is the mere implementation of what this video is all about.

Be open-minded, sit back and enjoy!
