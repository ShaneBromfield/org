A common mistake is that ctime is the file creation time. This is not correct, it is the inode/file change time. mtime is the file modification time. A often heard question is "What is the ctime, mtime and atime?".This is confusing so let me explain the difference between ctime, mtime and atime.
ctime

* ctime

Inode/file change time

Updated when file attributes are changed (ex: changing the owner, changing the permissions, moving file to

* mtime
File modification time

updated when:
- file is modified (content updated)
- file is saved

*Note*
Most of the times, ctime and mtime are the same.

* atime

File access time.

Updated when:
- opening a file
- using a file for operations like grep, sort, cat, head, tail and so on.
