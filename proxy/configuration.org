#+title: debian proxy configuration
#+author: ardumont

I have a slow network.
Once one machine has downloaded a package, I'd like it to be available to all my other machines.
Here comes deb-squid-proxy.

* server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install deb-squid-proxy
#+END_SRC

* clients

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install deb-squid-proxy-client
#+END_SRC

This will install a file to autodetect a proxy via avahi:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect "/usr/share/squid-deb-proxy-client/apt-avahi-discover";
#+END_SRC

* Avoid proxy

The thing that might pose problem is that if you have some internal
repository you cannot access through that proxy when apt-get update.
You then have 403 forbidden all other the places. It's because, your
client is accessing all the repositories through the proxy.

You can define then some rule to ignore the proxy for specific
repository.  For example in the same file add:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
Acquire::http::Proxy {
    your.repository.to.access.directly DIRECT;
};
#+END_SRC
