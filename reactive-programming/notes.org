** DONE What is reactive programming?
CLOSED: [2013-11-05 mar. 14:15]

Reactive: readily responsive to stimulus

Reacts to:
- events (event-driven)
- load (scalable)
- failures (resilient)
- users (responsive)


Event-driven -> scalable  ->
             -> resilient -> responsive
                          ->


** Traditionally
multiple threads (shared, synchronized state) -> strong coupling, hard to compose

** Now
composed from loosely coupled event-handlers -> events can be handled asynchronously, without blocking

** scalable
an applications is scalable if it can expand according to its usage:
- scale up: make use of parallelism in multi-core system
- scale out: make use of multiple server nodes

important for scalability: minimize shared mutable state
important for scale out: location transparency, resilience


** resilient
recover quickly from failure

failures can be:
- software
- hardware
- connection

it is not an afterthought, it needs to be part of the design from the beginning

** responsive

rich, real-time interaction with its users even under load and in the presence of failures

** fundamental constructions
to get composable event abstractions
- events are first-class
- events are often represented as messages
- handlers of events are also first-class
- complex handlers can be composed from primitive ones

*** Def
monad M is a parametric type M[T] with 2 operations, flatMap (bind) and unit that have to satisfy some laws:
- associativity
- left unit
- right unit

In scala, we can see the monad as a trait:

#+begin_src scala
trait M[T] {
  def flatMap[U](f: T => M[U]): M[U]
}

def unit[T](x: T): M[T]
#+end_src

Example of monads:
- List with unit(x) is List(x)
- Set with unit(x) is Set(x)
- Option with unit(x) is Some(x)
- Generator with unit(x) is single(x)
*** Monads and map

map can be defined as a combination between flatMap and unit.

#+begin_src scala
m map f == m flatMap (f andThen unit)
#+end_src

*** Monad laws
*** Associativity

(m flatMap f) flatMap g == m flatMap ( x => f(x) flatMap g f)

*** Left unit

unit(x) flatMap f == f(x)

*** Right unit
m flatMap unit == m
* IN-PROGRESS week 2 [100%]
** DONE 4 - 1 - Functions and State
CLOSED: [2013-11-12 mar. 13:16]
Without side effect, the concept of time is not important.

Substitution model: programs can be evaluated by rewriting.
As there is no side effect, only reformulation of one's program by replacing each call by it's definition expanding the values.

*** Remarks

Rewriting can be done anywhere in a term.

All rewritings which terminate lead to the same result -> confluence (a.k.a Church-Rosser theorem)

*** Stateful objects
Stateful -> changes over the course of time.

"an object has a state if its behavior is influenced by its history"

*** Implementation of state

In scala, every form of mutable state is constructed from variables.

*** State in objects

objects with state -> objects with variable

Example: Bank Account

#+begin_src scala
 class BankAccount {
  private var balance = 0
  def deposit(amount: Int): Unit = {
    if (amount > 0) balance += amount
  }

  def withdraw(amount: Int): Int = {
    if (0 < amount && amount <= balance) {
      balance -= amount
        balance
    }
  }
}

val acct = new BankAccount
acct deposit 50
acct withdraw 20
acct withdraw 20
acct withdraw 15 // -> Error

#+end_src

*** Statefulness and variables

**** Example 1
#+begin_src scala
def cons[T](hd: T, tl: => Stream[T]) = new Stream[T] {
    def head = hd
    private var tlOpt: Option[Stream[T]] = None
    def tail: T = tlOpt match {
      case Some(x) => x
      case None    => tlOpt = Some(tl); tail
    }
}
#+end_src

Is the result of cons a stateful object?

- No   -> if the tail is pure (without side effect), this is not.

- Yes  -> if the tail is side-effecty, tail will depend on the history so yes

**** Example2

#+begin_src scala
class BankAccountProxy(ba: BankAccount) {
  def deposit(amount: Int): Unit = ba.deposit(amount)
  def withdraw(amount: Int): Int = ba.withdraw(amount)
}
#+end_src

Are instances of BankAccountProxy stateful objects?

Yes -> same call won't result in the same result each time.

*** Assignment poses new problem
Assignment poses the new problem of deciding whether 2 expressions are the same.

#+begin_src scala
val x = E; val y = E; // -> safe to assume that x and y are the same (val so no assignment).
#+end_src

we could also have written:

#+begin_src scala
val x = E; val y = x;
#+end_src

-> referential transparency

*** Example

#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
#+end_src

Are x and y are the same?
No

*** What's "being the same"?

property of "operational equivalence" <-> x and y are operationally equivalent if no possible test can distinguish between them.

How:
- Execute multiple arbitrary definitions on both x and y and check the possible outcomes.
#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
f (x, y)
#+end_src

- Then execute the definitions with another sequence S obtained by replacing each x occurrence by y
#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
f (x, x)
#+end_src

- Then create another sequence S' by replace x by y in every sequence of S
#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
f (y, y)
#+end_src

- if the results are different then the expressions x and y are certainly different

- if all possible pairs of sequences (S, S') produce the same result, then x and y are the same.

*** Example

**** First round

#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
x deposit 30  // val res1: Int = 30
y withdraw 20 // -> error
#+end_src

**** Second
#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = new BankAccount
x deposit 30  // val res1: Int = 30
x withdraw 20 // val res1: Int = 10
#+end_src

**** conclusion

The final result is different then x and y are different

*** Another Example

#+begin_src scala
val x = new BankAccount
val y = x
x deposit 30  // val res1: Int = 30
y withdraw 20 // -> error
#+end_src

Here, using the same experiment, we obtain the same result so x and y are the same.

*** Assignment and substitution model
With previous examples, we can see that the substitution model can no longer be used with assignments.

** DONE 4 - 4 - Loops
CLOSED: [2013-11-12 mar. 14:13]
With assignment, variables are enough to model all imperative programs.
Loop is an unnecessary construct.

Example of the "power" method using the useless native while operation.

*** WHILE

WHILE as a functional function:

#+begin_src scala
def WHILE(condition: => Boolean)(command: => Unit): Unit =
 if (condition) {
   command
   WHILE(condition)(command)
} else ()
#+end_src

Note:
- condition and command must be passed by name so that they're reevaluated in each iteration
- WHILE is tail-recursive so it can operate with a constant stack size

*** REPEAT

Write a function implementing a repeat loop (Repeat the command until the condition is met).

#+begin_src scala
def REPEAT(command: => Unit)(condition: => Boolean): Unit = {
  command
  if (condition) ()
  else REPEAT(command)(condition)
}
#+end_src

CLOSED: [2013-11-12 mar. 22:54]
*** Digital circuit
It's composed of:
- wires (transport signals)
- functional components (transform signals)

based components:
- inverter - output is the inverse of its input
- AND      - output is the conjunction of the inputs
- OR       - output is the disjunction of the inputs

Other components are built by combining these base components.

/Note/
Components have a reaction time (delay). Their outputs do not change immediately after a change of their inputs.

def andGate(a1: Wire, a2: Wire, output: Wire): Unit
def orGate(o1: Wire, o2: Wire, output: Wire): Unit
#+end_src

*** Constructing Components

**** Half-adder

Definition:
s = a | b & !(a & b)
c = a & b

#+begin_src scala
def halfAdder(a: Wire, b: Wire, s: Wire, c: Wire): Unit = {
  val d = new Wire
  val e = new Wire

  orGate(a, b, d)
  andGate(a, b, c)
  inverter(c, e)
  andGate(d, e, s)
}
#+end_src

[[./resources/half-adder.png]]

**** Full-adder

composed of 2 full-adders:

#+begin_src scala
def fullAdder(a: Wire, b: Wire, cin: Wire, sum: Wire, cout: Wire): Unit = {
  val s = new Wire
  val c1 = new Wire
  val c2 = new Wire

  halfAdder(b, cin, s, c1)
  halfAdder(a, s, sum, c2)
  orGate(c1, c2, cout)
}
#+end_src

[[./resources/full-adder.png]]


**** Exercise: Mystery function

#+begin_src scala
def f(a: Wire, b: Wire, c: Wire): Unit = {
  val d, e, f, g = Wire
  inverter(a, d)
  inverter(b, e)
  andGate(a, e, f)
  andGate(b, d, g)
  orGate(f, g, c)
}
#+end_src

Question: What logical function does this program describe?

Answer: a != b (xor)

d = !a
e = !b
f = a & !b
g = b & !a
c = f | g = (a & !b) | (b & !a)

CLOSED: [2013-11-12 mar. 23:37]
*** Discrete event Simulation
a discrete event simulator performs actions, specified by the user at a given moment.

A action is a function that does not take any parameters and which returns Unit:

#+begin_src scala
type Action = () => Unit
#+end_src

The time is simulated, it has nothing to do with actual time.

*** Simulation trait

A concrete simulation happens inside an object that inherits from the trait Simulation:

#+begin_src scala
trait Simulation {
  // return the current simulated time
  def currentTime: Int = ???
  // registers an action to perform after a certain delay (relative to currentTime)
  def afterDelay(delay: Int)(block: => Unit): Unit = ???
  // performs the simulation until there are no more actions waiting
  def run(): Unit = ???
}
#+end_src
