* Statements
- I'm a feedback addict
When I execute something, I want it to answer quickly, no lag is acceptable.
- I found out that there is no faster than the keyboard to input quickly (at least as fast as my fingers go)
The mouse is slow because you need to break the position of your hands...
- I love emacs and [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]
- I like [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] (simple and user-friendly).
But you have too much to do and click to succeed in making one article.

* Consequence

I have difficulties in blogging directly in [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] (it is in the click world, I'm not anymore).

* But... *help me org-mode-wan, you are my only hope*

I know [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. And as soon as I become aware of [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]'s abilities to export, I used the html export to make my articles.

You write offline (no network problem then) your article in [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] (simple yet ultra powerfull text dsl).
Then you export in html (C-c C-e b), this will open a tab in your browser almost immediately.

It is way cool...

But the html need to be :
- copy/paste to [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] the rendered html
- the rendering of org-mode table via the copy/past of the exported html is not good
- as the exported html is a standalone one, it comes with some css we need to remove too (as [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] already has one)
- if images there are, you must upload first one at a time... and then remodify the either the org-mode or the html exported
- etc...

In short, a lot of manual adaptation needs to be done.
It's neither feedback oriented nor fun!

In even shorter, it's not perfect!

* Then along came... [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]]!

** What is it?

It's an adapter between [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] files and [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]].
Given minor setup steps (to do once), you can never leave your [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] buffer until you're done!

It's the ultimate blogging way for an org-mode user like me!

** Advantages?

- No network needed (at least until the publishing step)
- No need to manage the pictures, there will be uploaded and be coherent with the blog
- You will be prompted to create the categories if they do not already exist.

** install?

Here we go, add this to your *init.el*
This is a snippet of code that permits you to automatically search and install the packages you want at startup.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)

(when (not package-archive-contents)
  (package-refresh-contents))

(defvar my-packages '(org
                      xml-rpc
                      org2blog)
  "A list of packages to ensure are installed at launch.")

(dolist (p my-packages)
  (when (not (package-installed-p p))
    (package-install p)))

#+END_SRC

Here is the details about packages:

|----------+-----------------------------------------------|
| org      | org-mode                                      |
| xml-rpc  | An elisp implementation of clientside XML-RPC |
| org2blog | Blog from Org mode to wordpress               |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------|

** setup?

*** ~/.netrc

To setup the credentials to login into the [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]].

Here is a sample:
#+BEGIN_SRC netrc
machine some-dummy-machine login some-login password some-password
#+END_SRC

Each line represents one blog.

|----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| machine  | some-dummy-machine (Note that this will be used in the emacs-lisp code) |
| login    | some-login                                                              |
| password | some-password                                                           |
|----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*** ~/.emacs
Add this to your *~/.emacs*

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
;; depends on netrc, xml-rpc
(require 'netrc)
(require 'org2blog-autoloads)
(require 'metaweblog)

;; load the entry 'some-dummy-machine' in the ~/.netrc, we obtain a hash-map with the needed data
(setq blog (netrc-machine (netrc-parse "~/.netrc") "some-dummy-machine" t))

;; now enter the data in the org2blog list of blogs
(setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
      '(("some-dummy-machine"
         :url "http://your-wordpress-blog/xmlrpc.php"
         :username (netrc-get blog "login")
         :password (netrc-get blog "password"))))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org2blog/wp-mode)
#+END_SRC

This will load your credentials and activate the org2blog/wp-mode each time a [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file is launched.

** Use

Here is my way, you can go from this at first and then improve :D

- Add some metadata on your file

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+TITLE: Blogging with org-mode and org2blog to publish on wordpress
#+AUTHOR: Antoine R. Dumont
#+OPTIONS:
#+TAGS: org-mode, emacs, wordpress, blog
#+CATEGORY: org-mode, blog, wordpress
#+DESCRIPTION: Syncing one's org-mode files with one's blog
#+END_SRC

- Then You edit normally your [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file article, here is a full example

#+INCLUDE: "./resources/org/dummy.org" src org

- To check the rendering is ok, export locally your article via *C-c C-e b* (*M-x org-export-as-html-and-open*)

[[file:./resources/img/export-dummy.png][file:./resources/img/export-dummy.png]]

- Once you're almost ready, you can upload a draft to your [[http://wordpress.org/][wordpress]] *C-c d* (*M-x org2blog/wp-post-buffer*)

[[file:./resources/img/export-dummy-and-upload-draft.png][file:./resources/img/export-dummy-and-upload-draft.png]]

- New metadata has been generated at the top of your [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] file

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+BLOG: tony-blog
#+POSTID: 589
#+DATE: [2012-12-22 Sat 20:00]
#+END_SRC

This will help in updating your post throughout the time.

- When ready to publish, hit *C-c p* (or *C-u M-x org2blog/wp-post-buffer*)

- Of course, you can republish after updating some errors/typos (hit *C-c p* again when you're done updating it)

* Enjoy

At last, the perfect way of blogging through emacs! At least for me!

Long live [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]]!
