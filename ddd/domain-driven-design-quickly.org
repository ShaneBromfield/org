Most of it is due to OOP!

* Ubiquitous language
- Represent the domain model
- One-to-one mapping from the domain language and the technical language to represent an understandable model for everyone involved
- Need to be crafted with the domain expert and the developers
* Layer architecture - Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure
Each layer must be dependent of only the layer below and no other.

** Entities (identity)
- Domain object
- possible internal state
** Value objects (no identity)
- immutable
- stateless
** Services
- Verb/Action
- Important behaviour of the domain which is cross-domain to many entities.
- No internal state
- encapsulate a concept
- Act as interface which provide operations
- permits a low degree of coupling between objects

- 3 characteristics, operation performed by the service:
  - refers to a domain concept which does not naturally belong to an entity or Value object
  - refers to other objects of the domain
  - is stateless
- Service can belong to:
  - domain layer: if the operation is about domain objects
  - application layer

** Modules
- used as a method of organizing related concepts and tasks
- to reduce complexity
- understand relations between modules then understand the details inside the module
- code quality
- group highly related classes to provide maximum cohesion
- communication cohesion: parts of the module operate on the same data
- functional cohesion: all parts of the module work together to perform a well-defined task
- should have well-defined interfaces which other module consume (to reduce the coupling)
- Name of module must be part of the Ubiquitous language

** Aggregates
*** Properties
- used to define object ownership and boundaries
- deal with relations between objects
  - pays off to reduce or remove relations from the model
  - one-to-one
  - one-to-many (one object -> One collection if possible)
  - many-to-many (if bidirectional is optional, make it unidirectional, it simplifies the model)
- enforce the invariant
- invariant: rules which have to be maintained whenever data changes
*** Definition
Group of associated objects which are considered one unit with regard to data changes.
Only the root element (entity) has access to such aggregates. It can update the aggregate.
It enforces the invariant.
** Factories
- Encapsultate the process of complex object creation (entity, value object)
- Deal with aggregate
- Enforce the invariant creation
- Atomic creation
- if problem during creation, exception should be raised
*** Factory method
- contains and hide knowledge necessary to create another object
*** Abstract factory
*** Constructor
Use when:
- construction is not complicated
- creation of an object does not involve the creation of others and all the attributes are passed via a constructor
- the client is interested in the implementation
- the class is the type. No hierarchy involved.

** Repositories
- Deal with object storage
- Access to the storage facility
- Abstract away the storage metadata
- Strategy
- Hold reference to objects
* Refactoring
- continuous
- code
- but also domain!
- change in model must be reflected in code and vice-versa
- breakthrough
- banish implicit concept, they must be exposed!
- Refactoring must improve and clarify everything
- Reconcile contradictions
- Specification (Constraint)

* Preserving model integrity
** Bounded context
** Continuous integration
