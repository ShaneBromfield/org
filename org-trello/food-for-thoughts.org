As a food for thoughts...

Many people have great ideas and other workflows.
I have not enough time to satisfy everyone.

Having an (org-)trello-core library could help making other modes.

For example:
- #33 - other buffer's layout organization
- simple data backup of their boards
- many other stuff i don't even imagine yet

(org-)trello-core would then be in charge of:
- requests to trello's api (with authentication)
- parsing response and provide them as data to other modes to do as they wish

This seems like the actual following namespaces:
- org-trello-api
- org-trello-query
- org-trello-data
- some other functions + variables dispatch somewhere else

The first plugin (and example) would then be org-trello.

It would actually have nothing to do with org-mode.
So we could drop the org-trello and simply call it `trello-core`...

Cheers,
