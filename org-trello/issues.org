: [Trello saves card due dates in UTC](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/24741/what-time-zone-are-due-dates-in), so all times from the org-trello buffer should be converted to UTC before updating Trello, and from UTC before importing into the org-trello buffer.
:
: For example, if I set a time using [org-mode's deadline feature](http://orgmode.org/manual/Deadlines-and-scheduling.html) (default binding is `C-c C-d`) to 2015-07-14 at 18:00, then I am prompted the date selection via [emacs' calendar tool](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/org_dates/#sec-6) then org-mode outputs this line: `DEADLINE: <2015-07-14 Tue 18:00>`. If I am in PST (ie Seattle, WA, USA), this line should be converted to its UTC equivalent `DEADLINE: <2015-07-15 Wed 01:00>` before updating my Trello card.
:
: The same thing goes for importing dates from the Trello board - the dates are currently imported to the org-trello buffer in UTC. For example, if I use Trello's GUI to set a date for 2015-07-14 at 18:00, and I am in PST, Trello stores that date internally as 2015-07-15 at 01:00, and org-trello imports that date as `DEADLINE: <2015-07-15T01:00:00.000Z>`. (NOTE: It appears the DEADLINE format is not affected by Trello or org-trello, so `DEADLINE: <2015-07-15T01:00:00.000Z>` and `DEADLINE: <2015-07-15 Wed 01:00>` are equivalent)
:
: I think the best approach is to convert all deadlines from UTC to the user's local timezone when syncing from Trello to the org-trello buffer, and converting all deadlines from the user's local timezone to UTC when syncing from the org-trello buffer to Trello. Let me know if there is a better approach.

: I'm not sure if this really is an issue, but it's certainly something I could do with help on.
:
: I want to have a board synced by org-trello as a capture file for org mode with C-c c. This is easily done via setting `org-capture-templates`, but I then run into the issue of my org file having a load of cards that haven't been pushed to Trello yet. Therefore I put `(add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook 'org-trello/sync-card)` to my startup config, which very nearly does what I want. However, it leaves a `:PROPERTIES: {}` in the file where I started the capture from, which is obviously not desirable.
:
: I had a fairly long debugging session in #emacs about this (thanks scottj!) and he eventually concluded that it was due to the asynchronicity of org-trello. Is this something that can be fixed? Or am I going to have to come up with something more imaginative in my config?

: Hello and thank you for the org-trello,
:
: I am currently trying to make it work for but I experience a strange bug which doesn't occur with only org-mode.
:
: When I add a checklist to a card and hit Enter the checklist is automatically indented by 2 characters.
: If I save the file (after removing the indent) the checklist is indented again.
:
: (And sometimes, while working on a test.trello file)
: If I add another checklist or hit Enter again the above checklist is again indented by 2 characters.
:
: When things are not so bad, the produced file looks like this:
:
: ```
: * TODO Test this stuff
:   - [ ] This check list
:     - [ ] Test item
:       - [ ] and This item
: ```
:
: When I try to synchronize with trello the check list is converted to an item because of the indent and everything else is trashed.
:
: When I disable org-trello-mode, remove the extra spaces and save I get the expected file without the indent but when I enable org-trello-mode again the extra indent comes back.
:
: And when I edit a regular .org file I don't have the problem and org saves me this:
:
: ```
: * TODO Test this stuff
: - [ ] This check list
:   - [ ] Test item
:     - [ ] and This item
: ```
:
: Any idea what could be wrong with my setup?

:END:
: With relatively active conversations in comments, it becomes hard to look for new ones, and to follow those conversations, while synchronization reloads the whole buffer, folds headings, and does not mark cards with new comments. Probably it'd be tricky to solve all that in org-mode, but that would make it more suitable for such a workflow. Also, automatic synchronization with notifications on the mode line would be useful, too.

:END:
: It would be great if org-trello allows for addition/removal of files to its list of files (see #210).
:
: The reason to add this is for the following scenario:
: * User creates a new board
: * User syncs up metadata for board with org-trello using C-c o I and syncs any new cards with C-c o s
: * User saves the org-trello file
: * Next time user starts emacs, this new file is already in org-trello mode and ready to go.
:
: Without this feature, user has to remember to manually add the org-trello file to the list.
:
: This could be modeled around how org-agenda also allows addition/removal of a file that is already open through certain key-bindings
:
: "C-c [" (org-agenda-file-to-front)
: Add current file to the list of agenda files. The file is added to the front of the list. If it was already in the list, it is moved to the front. With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the end.
: "C-c ]" (org-remove-file)
: Remove current file from the list of agenda files.
:
: org-agenda uses defcustom to set this up like this for example:
:
: ```lisp
: ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿(custom-set-variables  '(org-agenda-files (quote ("~/Dropbox/Org/event-persister.org" "~/Dropbox/Org/cdn-log-processor.org" "~/Dropbox/Org/gtd.org" "~/Dropbox/Org/notes.org"))))

: Hi, trello-org is a nice piece of code - well done!
:
: Our use case for trello is very different:
:
: List names are major category headings - so level 1 org headings
: Card names correspond to category 2 org headings
: My group makes extensive use of comments  - they are similar to category 3 headings

: I was thinking of digging in to this and seeing if I could modify the repo to suit.

: Although the user did not enter proper markdown, Trello is still able to correctly render the bullets, so I think `org-trello` should import them as bullets as well. Possibly all strings that start with "* " can be prefixed with a space? Like "* " -> " * "?

: Replace internal mechanism with `completing-read`, this will simplify code.
:
: ```txt
: completing-read is a built-in function in `minibuf.c'.
:
: (completing-read PROMPT COLLECTION &optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)
:
: Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.
: PROMPT is a string to prompt with; normally it ends in a colon and a space.
: COLLECTION can be a list of strings, an alist, an obarray or a hash table.
: COLLECTION can also be a function to do the completion itself.
: PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of COLLECTION.
: See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details
:  on completion, COLLECTION, and PREDICATE.
:
: REQUIRE-MATCH can take the following values:
: - t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
:   the input is (or completes to) an element of COLLECTION or is null.
: - nil means that the user can exit with any input.
: - `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
:   to confirm her choice if the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
: - `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
:   input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
:   `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
:   and the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
: - anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
:   does non-null completion.
:
: If the input is null, `completing-read' returns DEF, or the first element
: of the list of default values, or an empty string if DEF is nil,
: regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.
:
: If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
:   with point positioned at the end.
:   If it is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input is STRING, but point
:   is placed at _zero-indexed_ position POSITION in STRING.  (*Note*
:   that this is different from `read-from-minibuffer' and related
:   functions, which use one-indexing for POSITION.)  This feature is
:   deprecated--it is best to pass nil for INITIAL-INPUT and supply the
:   default value DEF instead.  The user can yank the default value into
:   the minibuffer easily using M-n.
:
: HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally the initial
:   position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the history list
:   variable to use, or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In
:   that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and HISTPOS
:   is the initial position (the position in the list used by the
:   minibuffer history commands).  For consistency, you should also
:   specify that element of the history as the value of
:   INITIAL-INPUT.  (This is the only case in which you should use
:   INITIAL-INPUT instead of DEF.)  Positions are counted starting from
:   1 at the beginning of the list.  The variable `history-length'
:   controls the maximum length of a history list.
:
: DEF, if non-nil, is the default value or the list of default values.
:
: If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits
:   the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.
:
: Completion ignores case if the ambient value of
:   `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil.
:
: See also `completing-read-function'.

: Adding the position inside the cache checksum annihilates the checksum computation's needs...
:
: # Detail
:
: Since the position triggers a checksum computation, all the checksums below one line modification means that for the next sync to trello, this will trigger a sync for any entities below that point...
: Which can be a lot depending on the current position...
:
: We are in a trade-off situation, removing the position from the checksum computation.
: And then we can benefit from the checksum because we sync to trello only what's really changed.
: But then, we can reopen #250...
:
: Or, we keep the position inside the checksum computation (as per actual implementation).
: But then again, we sync to trello almost everything each time we write inside the buffer (thus rendering almost useless the checksum computation itself)...
:
: As a trade-off of the trade-off (in waiting for a better solution), make this behavior an option for the user...

: Hey folks,
:
: Wondering if the above is possible. It might just be some elisp but maybe somebody can help me with it.
:
: I have seen the variable for setting a list of fixed filenames, but it seems to me to make more sense to configure a file extension to use for trello board files.

: Hi,
:
: I have just installed org-trello from melpa following the documentation.
: When i try to import a board into a new org file (C-u C-c o s), the cards are imported but the indentation of the cards is broken. For example:
:
: ```txt
: * Basics Welcome to Trello!
:   :PROPERTIES...
:
:   * Basics This is a card.
:     :PROPERTIES...
: ```
:
: I got two spaces before the second card and the next ones.
: I'm using emacs 24.4.1 with org-mode 8.2.10
: org-trello comes from melpa (v 20150208)
:
: Steps to reproduce:
: 1. Open a new org file and load org-trello-mode
: 2. Connect the buffer to a board: C-c o I and choose "Welcome Board"
: 3. Sync from trello: C-u C-c o s

: Awesome project!
:
: When I first installed `org-trello`, my emacs was installed from the [ubuntu emacs list](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) snapshots, which now installs emacs 25.
:
: I could complete the setup process (consumer key and token), but when calling org-trello commands to sync, it would most often just hang, and I'd have to kill and restart emacs. Very strange, occasionally it would work, but I couldn't find out when.
:
: Then I installed emacs 24.4.1 from source and now it works well.

: !!!! Thank you so much for the extended comment support (#227) !!!!
:
: It works like a charm!
:
: The only unfortunate thing is, that I need to work with org-mode 8.3beta and there the heading structure breaks after the first comment.
:
: I guess this happens due to an text overlay problem since this issue only occurs, if org-trello-mode is switched on.
:
: I hope this is not a big thing issue. Maybe you would want to take a look at this, before the soon upcoming release of org-mode 8.3.
:
: Here is the reproducible symptom in detail:
:
: 0) Switch to org-mode version 8.3beta.
: 1) Create a new trello board (on trello) with one card and add a comment.
: 2) Create a second comment or another card.
: 2) C-c o I  and  C-u C-c o s  in order to sync the whole board.
: 3) The org-buffer looks perfect, but as soon as I save it (C-x C-s) everything below the first comment appears as text and the stars of all following headlines are not color-coded anymore. As a result, if I want to sync the buffer back to trello, the whole board will be messed up completely.
: 4) Crosscheck: When reverting the buffer (state before saving) and switching off org-trello-mode then saving the buffer works perfectly.

: Hello.
: First of all, I'm new to Trello, and chances are that the problems described below shouldn't even appear with the intended workflow. Yet Trello allows such situations to appear.
:
: The first problem I've ran into was about multiline comments: they are truncated after the first line break when trying to read (`C-u C-c o C`), and it's not nice to write them in the minibuffer. Neither it is nice to write long comments there, nor to read relatively long conversations, and there's no way to edit/delete the comments. Probably it all could be solved by adding comments under second-level headlines, like this:
: ```
: * <category> <card title>
:   :PROPERTIES:...
:
:   <card description>
: ** <user>, <date>
:    <comment text>
: ```
:
: The second one is about synchronization: with relatively active conversations in comments, it becomes hard to look for new ones, and to follow those conversations, while synchronization reloads the whole buffer, folds headings, and does not mark cards with new comments. Probably it'd be tricky to solve all that in org-mode, but that would make it more suitable for such a workflow. Also, automatic synchronization with notifications on the mode line would be useful, too.
:
: Both issues come from trying to use Trello as an issue tracker, I guess, but if it is doable, makes sense, and could be useful for other users, we could discuss how to do it.

: I would love to be able to test org-trello since I recently started using trello but unfortunately, I can't, because it seems that org-trello automatically changes default org tree indentation rendering the tree useless to view in (for example) the org agenda.
: This is with org-20141006 and org-trello-20141004.218 from MELPA.
:
: Steps to reproduce (once org-trello is enabled) are simple for me:
: 1) Create a test.org file
: 2) Start creating structure like this:
: *abc
: **def
: 3) Save the file. The org file now automatically changes to
: *abc
: __**def
: Notice the change in indentation for "**def"

:
: Trello uses Markdown for markup, while Org uses its own markup.  They should be transformed into one another when synchronizing.
:
: Otherwise, Trello markup will not be rendered correctly by Emacs once the Trello text has been transferred in Org, and Trello will not render Org markup correctly either the other way around.

: pre-requisite:
: - non emacs-lisp dependencies (from a dev point of view, I was really tempted to have a clojure server part to ease the dev but from a user point of view, I thought this was tedious)
:
: status:
: - elnode is used as a proxy that executes the trello requests.
: - clojurescript orchestrates clojure dsl code and compiles it into js code
: - elnode is a web server (so it can serve static files including js)
: - [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) - is "A Clojure library designed to provide facilities for async programming and communication."
: - core.async can be used with clojurescript
: - the webadmin part fetches the static code to serve the first time the call to the http://localhost:9876/proxy/admin webpage is loaded
:
: idea:
: - delegates all trello requests through clojurescript code (using core.async for concurrency purposes)

:   - [X] Can't we simply use 'deferred (or 'async library) to defer computations? -> Yes, building actions (sync, delete) as 'lazy' list (macro) of deferred computations.
:   - [X] What about concurrency then? There will be indeed possibilities of concurrent requests.
:   - [X] What about race conditions then? We need to find a way to compose deferred computations -> [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-deferred][deferred]] seems able to do so

: Hello!
:
: It seems org-trello can't sync over over proxy. I have tried to fetch changes from trello and push some changes to trello. According to logs in \*Messages\* all is ok (see below). But nothing changed in buffer on trello. I have tried to sync via other network (without proxy): My test board was successfully synced.
:
: Proxy settings are available in emacs environment (http_proxy and https_proxy): getenv returns correct proxy server. These settings were enough for other tasks. Should I add something special for org-trello (or for elnode)? What debug info can I collect to find root cause for this issue?
:
: Thanks for useful org-mode extension!

: # History
:
: org-trello:
: - was developed in multiple files (because I like namespaces)
: - was not packaged
: - has been packaged to melpa
: - then problems in multiple files
: - so become one file to ease packaging (at the time)
: - then has been packaged to marmalade
: - became too big for one file, rendering emacs slow and dev painful
: - as a consequence was splitted into many files
: - then problems arise in multiple packaging way
: - so code to fix packages
: - then code to maintain ease of dev which was no longer simple (move forward and back into code)
: - and code to maintain tests
: - ...
:
: To sum up, all hell break loose!
:
: # State of the art
:
: At the moment, org-trello is splitted into multiple files in the src folder (cf. README-dev.md)
:
: When it's time to package, there exists a makefile target which aggregates all those files into one org-trello.el. This is this file which is packaged in melpa and marmalade.
:
: When testing, all the code is loaded and then tests began.
:
: This:
: - is complex
: - is not standard (thus rendering potential PR more difficult -> needs to read the README-dev.md to understand the flow)
: - had made me do some code to load org-trello specifically for dev and test.
:
: # Conclusion
:
: It's time to move back towards standard (yes it was!).
:
: # Hints
: - See https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa/issues/1704#issuecomment-42683377
: - look at magit or org to see how they worked with splitted files.
:
: # Impacts
:
: - Simplification (good)
: - melpa packaging -> PR to melpa to adapt the recipes
: - marmalade packaging (all in org-trello repository so no worry I think)

: C-c o s on a Trello board did some extensive damage, checking items that should have stayed unchecked, and unchecking items that should have stayed checked.  One of my coworkers shared his feeling that the logic was all inverted.
:
: But I'm not so sure.  Another coworker sent me all Trello notifications he got, so I could revert them.  I noticed that for one big card indeed, the logic seemed to be inverted.  However, there are other cards that I apparently did not have to touch.  Maybe my coworker did not sent me all notifications he got, or did not get them all?  I'll have to check further to find hints about what else need to be repaired on that board.

: Hi, Antoine.  Here is a more philosophical one.
:
: In a Trello board, there are many columns, and each column gives access to many cards.
:
: org-trello presumes that these columns represent state, and that Trello users "progress" a card by moving it between columns; which is reflected with TODO progression on the Org side.  Which is nice, of course.
:
: But columns may represent something else than state.  They may be used to group cards according to really all kind of criteria.  It would be far better if org-trello was reflecting the two level structure (columns/card) by two-level structure of headers on the Org side: the outer level representing the column, the inner level representing the card within the column.
:
: The assumption made by org-trello that Trello columns are only used for state becomes an encumberance, as all cards within columns are all shown at the same level, with the card column identification used as a prefix.  On the Org side, users have no clean way to collapse columns they do not want to see, they rather get overly long lists, sometimes with keywords not even grouped, which is confusing overall.
:
: In a way, that's a bit sad that the #+TODO trickery, which is clever deep down, is not always to be used.  But this is a bit like imposing a way to use Trello, rather than reflecting Trello usage in its generality.  Maybe an option could be available, or compromises done, to salvage the trickery, but in my opinion, it should not be the default.  org-trello should reflect Trello structure in priority, and give much less prominence to particular usages.

: Hi, Antoine.  Here I am again, hoping you are not tired of reading me.
:
: I'm a bit lost with how to proceed with the dependency org-trello has on Org, in Marmelade.  I postponed that problem for a few days already, but I now want to do something about it, so this issue, to request guidance or advice.
:
: I usually get Org mode from Git and install it locally.  Bastien has recent commits which are very useful to me, in my day to day work, so I'd rather use a bleeding edge Org.  The problem is that Git latest tag is 7.9.3e.  And indeed, M-x org-version yields:
:
:     Org-mode version 7,9.3e (7.9.3e-3023-g6d0932 @ /home/pinard/macs/_/org-mode/lisp/)
:
: This is after removing the package "org" from the package system, as I did this morning.  But then, when I start Emacs, there is a `*Warnings*` buffer with the following contents:
:
:     Warning (emacs): Unable to activate package `org-trello'.
:     Required package `org-8.0.7' is unavailable
:     Warning (emacs): Unable to activate package `org-trello'.
:     Required package `org-8.0.7' is unavailable
:
: One thing is that I do not understand why Marmelade uses version numbers for Org which are higher than the numbers in the bleeding edge version of Org.  Would I be using the wrong Git repository?  I clone from `git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git`.
:
: How may I, or should I, install org-trello, without pulling the version from Marmelade?  Is there something in org-trello that requires an older version of Org?  It would be infortunate, as I do not think I can have two version of Org installed simultaneously.
:
: As of now, I have the feeling I have to choose either org-trello, or some recent Org features.  I would prefer having both!

: Hi, Antoine.
:
: After "C-c o S", org-trello vertically aligns ":PROPERTIES: {"orgtrello-id":..." in lines, after all the checkitem texts.
:
: If one of these texts is overly long, which may very well happen in practice, the alignment then uses an inordinate amount of whitespace after all short checkitem texts in the same list.  This visually translates, in Emacs display, by many white lines between the checkitem text and the ":PROPERTIES: ..." suffix, spoiling a good amount of vertical space and so, decreasing legibility and comfort.
:
: My suggestion would be to preset some reasonable upper bound to the length of a checkitem text, for the purpose of computing the margin for the suffixes.  For texts having lenghtier than this upper bound, the suffix would be pushed on the right as needed for those lines.  And of course, if all texts are shorter than this upper bound, the margin for the suffixes could be made shorter as it is currently done.
:
: Now, what value should have this upper bound?  As the suffix seems to be 56 characters wide (at least on the example I have before my eyes), it would not be reasonable aiming 79 columns limit overall, like GNU standards suggest.  But the margin itself might be guaranteed no bigger than 79.  In that way, there will be no visual vertical waste in form of white lines, given an Emacs window is 80 character wide, which is the usual default and minimum in many display contexts.

: Hi, Antoine.
:
: This is a suggestion for a new little tool.  It would sometimes be convenient, quickly jumping from Emacs into the "real" Trello board or entry within a Web browser, for the case I want to see how Trello renders part of an Org buffer which has been org-trello-ized, or to address Trello capabilities which are not in org-trello yet, or even, merely to ease tests or toying around.  Could we have a keybinding and function to that effect?
:
: FranÃ§ois
:
: P.S. It would of course be fun also the other way around: from the browser within Trello, quickly jumping to the corresponding place in Org.  But one has to stay reasonable while adding demands into GitHub issues :-).

: Hi, Antoine.  This is a wish, not a bug report.  The Org manual, in section:
:
:   1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual
:
: (Top -> Introduction -> Conventions)
:
: chooses to write Org property names in capitals.  This does not mean that users have to use the same conventions, they may really do as they want.  Yet, I follow the conventions in my 350 or so Org files, and have a diagnostic program which (among many other things) reports to me when I am not consistent on such things.  This program started to barf on files generated by org-trello.  I could amend the program to detect trelloized files and become lenient for those specifically, but I dare suggesting changing org-trello instead. :-)
:
: If you agree, per some other issue of mine, to hide all such lines, it would not matter much to users anyway.
:
: So, my wish is that org-trello writes #+PROPERTY instead of #+property.  It already writes #+TODO, this particular one is written according to the manual convention.

: Hi, Antoine.
:
: Org allows checklist items to be marked "[ ]" (for undone), "[-]" (for half done) or "[X]" (for fully done).  Currently, org-trello seems to stick to either "[-]" or "[X]".
:
: The proper usage for "[-]" is a list having a sublist in which some items are done and some items are undone (or half done, but this likely does not apply for org-trello).  End items should either be done or undone, but never half done.  Trello does not have such a concept (so far that I know), so the current mapping is not really proper.

: Hi, Antoine, and org-trello users.
:
: I'm a bit annoyed by the block of #+property lines at the beginning of a synchronized org-trello buffer, which I would really prefer hidden.  This would be to decrease the visual pollution.
:
: I think that including all these within :PROPERTIES: and :END: lines is sufficient to do so.  I will try adding these lines myself, hoping they will survive synchronization! :-)  If they do, that Issue might be abandoned.
:
: Yet, I would guess that, for elegance, the default should be to hide these lines (and likely the #+TODO line as well) when generating them.
