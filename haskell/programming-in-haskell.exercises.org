* Introduction
1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

#+BEGIN_SRC pseudo
double (double 2) = (double 2) + (double 2)
                  = (double 2) + (2 + 2)
                  = (double 2) + 4
                  = (2 + 2) + 4
                  = 4 + 4
                  = 8
#+END_SRC

2. Show that sum [x] = x for any number x.

sum:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
#+END_SRC

Given the definition of the sum function:
#+BEGIN_SRC demo
sum [x] = x + sum []
        = x + 0
        = x
#+END_SRC

3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
and show using your definition that product [2, 3, 4] = 24.

product:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
pdt :: Num a => [a] -> a
pdt [] = 1
pdt (x:xs) = x * pdt xs
#+END_SRC

product [2,3,4] = 24?
#+BEGIN_SRC demo
pdt [2,3,4] = 2 * pdt [3,4]
            = 2 * 3 * pdt [4]
            = 2 * 3 * 4 * pdt []
            = 2 * 3 * 4 * 1
            = 24
#+END_SRC

4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

qsort:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
               where
                 smaller = filter (<= x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

We want to modify such qsort definition to reverse the output.
So from *qsort [4 6 2] => [2 4 6] into qsort [4 6 2] => 6 4 2.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort larger ++ [x] ++ qsort smaller
               where
                 smaller = filter (<= x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

To simplify the proof, we will prove that:
qsort [x] = [x]

#+BEGIN_SRC demo
qsort [x] = qsort [] ++ [x] ++ qsort []
          = [] ++ [x] ++ []
          = [x]
#+END_SRC

Now solve the question:
#+BEGIN_SRC demo
qsort [4,6,2] = qsort [6] ++ [4] ++ qsort [2]
              = [6] ++ [4] ++ [2]
              = [6,4,2]
#+END_SRC

5. What would be the effect of replacing by < in the original definition
of qsort ? Hint: consider the example qsort [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].

Given:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
               where
                 smaller = filter (< x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

This will filter out the duplicated entries.

Here is the solved example:
#+BEGIN_SRC demo
qsort [2,2,3,1,1] = qsort [1] ++ [2] ++ qsort [3]
                  = [1] ++ [2] ++ [3]
                  = [1,2,3]
#+END_SRC

* Chapter 2

1. Parenthesise the following arithmetic expressions:
2↑3∗4
2∗3+4∗5
2+3∗4↑5
2. Work through the examples from this chapter using Hugs.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
2^3*4 = (2^3)*4 = 32

2∗3+4∗5 = (2*3)+(4*5) = 26

2+3*4^5 = 2+(3*(4^5)) = 3074
#+END_SRC

3. The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors
and then check that your script works properly using Hugs.
#+BEGIN_SRC
N = a 'div' length xs
    where
      a = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
n = a `div` (length xs)
    where
      a  = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

4. Show how the library function last that selects the last element of a non-
empty list could be defined in terms of the library functions introduced
in this chapter. Can you think of another possible definition?

5. Show how the library function init that removes the last element from
a non-empty list could similarly be defined in two different ways.
