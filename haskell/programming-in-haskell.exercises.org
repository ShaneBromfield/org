* Introduction
1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

#+begin_src pseudo
double (double 2) = (double 2) + (double 2)
                  = (double 2) + (2 + 2)
                  = (double 2) + 4
                  = (2 + 2) + 4
                  = 4 + 4
                  = 8
#+end_src

2. Show that sum [x] = x for any number x.

3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
and show using your definition that product [2, 3, 4] = 24.

4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

5. What would be the effect of replacing by < in the original definition
of qsort ? Hint: consider the example qsort [2, 2, 3, 1, 1].
