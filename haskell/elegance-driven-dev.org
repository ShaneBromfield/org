A simple haskell script to add, see or delete entries in a todo file.

I find the args dispatch using HOF elegant!
And haskell is fast!

#+begin_src haskell
...

todoDelete :: [String] -> IO ()
todoDelete (file:index:_) = del file (read index)

todoSee :: [String] -> IO ()
todoSee (file:_) = view file

todoAdd :: [String] -> IO ()
todoAdd (file:todo) = add file (unwords todo)

dispatch :: [(String, [String] -> IO ())]
dispatch = [("del", todoDelete),
            ("see", todoSee),
            ("add", todoAdd)]

main :: IO ()
main = do (command:args) <- getArgs
          let (Just action) = (lookup command dispatch) in
            action args

* You're here because you know something.

* What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.

* You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.

* You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.

* It is this feeling that has brought you to me.

* Do you know what I'm talking about?
