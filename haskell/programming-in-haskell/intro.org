1. Give another possible calculation for the result of double (double 2).

#+BEGIN_SRC text
double (double 2) = (double 2) + (double 2)
                  = (double 2) + (2 + 2)
                  = (double 2) + 4
                  = (2 + 2) + 4
                  = 4 + 4
                  = 8
#+END_SRC

2. Show that sum [x] = x for any number x.

sum:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
sum :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum [] = 0
sum (x:xs) = x + sum xs
#+END_SRC

Given the definition of the sum function:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
sum [x] = x + sum []
        = x + 0
        = x
#+END_SRC

3. Define a function product that produces the product of a list of numbers,
and show using your definition that product [2, 3, 4] = 24.

product:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
pdt :: Num a => [a] -> a
pdt [] = 1
pdt (x:xs) = x * pdt xs
#+END_SRC

product [2,3,4] = 24?
#+BEGIN_SRC text
pdt [2,3,4] = 2 * pdt [3,4]
            = 2 * 3 * pdt [4]
            = 2 * 3 * 4 * pdt []
            = 2 * 3 * 4 * 1
            = 24
#+END_SRC

4. How should the definition of the function qsort be modified so that it
produces a reverse sorted version of a list?

qsort:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
               where
                 smaller = filter (<= x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

We want to modify such qsort definition to reverse the output.
So from qsort *[4 6 2] => [2 4 6]* into *qsort [4 6 2] => 6 4 2*.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort larger ++ [x] ++ qsort smaller
               where
                 smaller = filter (<= x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

To simplify the proof, we will prove that:
*qsort [x] = [x]*

#+BEGIN_SRC text
qsort [x] = qsort [] ++ [x] ++ qsort []
          = [] ++ [x] ++ []
          = [x]
#+END_SRC

Now solving the question:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
qsort [4,6,2] = qsort [6] ++ [4] ++ qsort [2]
              = [6] ++ [4] ++ [2]
              = [6,4,2]
#+END_SRC

5. What would be the effect of replacing by < in the original definition
of qsort ? Hint: consider the example *qsort [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]*.

Given:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
               where
                 smaller = filter (< x) xs
                 larger  = filter (> x) xs
#+END_SRC

This will filter out the duplicated entries.

Here is the solved example:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
qsort [2,2,3,1,1] = qsort [1] ++ [2] ++ qsort [3]
                  = [1] ++ [2] ++ [3]
                  = [1,2,3]
#+END_SRC
