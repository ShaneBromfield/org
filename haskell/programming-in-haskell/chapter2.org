* Chapter 2

1. Parenthesise the following arithmetic expressions:
2^3∗4
2∗3+4∗5
2+3∗4^5


2. Work through the examples from this chapter using Hugs.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
2^3*4 = (2^3)*4 = 32

2∗3+4∗5 = (2*3)+(4*5) = 26

2+3*4^5 = 2+(3*(4^5)) = 3074
#+END_SRC

3. The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors
and then check that your script works properly using Hugs.
#+BEGIN_SRC
N = a 'div' length xs
    where
      a = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
n = a `div` (length xs)
    where
      a  = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

4. Show how the library function last that selects the last element of a non-
empty list could be defined in terms of the library functions introduced
in this chapter. Can you think of another possible definition?

5. Show how the library function init that removes the last element from
a non-empty list could similarly be defined in two different ways.
