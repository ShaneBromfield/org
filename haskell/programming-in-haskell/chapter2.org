* Parenthesis

Parenthesise the following arithmetic expressions:
2^3∗4
2∗3+4∗5
2+3∗4^5

* Execution
Work through the examples from this chapter using Hugs.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
2^3*4 = (2^3)*4 = 32

2∗3+4∗5 = (2*3)+(4*5) = 26

2+3*4^5 = 2+(3*(4^5)) = 3074
#+END_SRC

* Fix errors

The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors
and then check that your script works properly using Hugs.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
N = a 'div' length xs
    where
      a = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

Fixed:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
n = a `div` (length xs)
    where
      a  = 10
      xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#+END_SRC

* Definition of last

Show how the library function *last* that selects the last element of a non-
empty list could be defined in terms of the library functions introduced
in this chapter. Can you think of another possible definition?

* init

Show how the library function init that removes the last element from
a non-empty list could similarly be defined in two different ways.
