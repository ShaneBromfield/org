I love to develop. The applications, the design, the performance, etc..., it's fun.

But then I also need to test the application, to ensure that this does what I think it does.

So I develop the application then for testing the application, I develop the unit/integration tests...

But then again, what has all in common the applications that crashed in production?
It passes the tests!!! (go see [[http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey][Rich Hickey's videos, it's way fun]]).

Indeed, we also develop the tests, so let me ask this, who's gonna test the tests? and then... the tests of the tests... and...

Another solution could be to generate some of the integration tests.
