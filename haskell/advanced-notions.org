* Monoid
A monoid is a system which obeys 3 rules:
- closure: t -> t -> t
- associativity: ∀a, b, c ∈ t: (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c ⇔ a ⊕ (b ⊕ c), ⊕: t -> t -> t
- identity: ∀ a ∈ t, a ⊕ 0 = 0 ⊕ a = a

Ex:
- Integer under the addition (0 is the identity)
- Integer under the Multiplication (1 is the identity)

* Semigroup
A semigroup is a system which obeys 3 rules:
- closure: t -> t -> t
- associativity: ∀a, b, c ∈ t: (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c ⇔ a ⊕ (b ⊕ c), ⊕: t -> t -> t
