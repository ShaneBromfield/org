* Detail

regexp-builder is awesome but it already does escape stuff so simply copy/paste ourselves the string won't work.
We need to use `C-c C-w` to copy the regexp into kill-ring.

* TL;DR

M-x regexp-builder RET

When regexp ready, `C-c C-w` and paste the result where you want.

* Hint

Change the string interpretation with

M-x reb-change-syntax RET
