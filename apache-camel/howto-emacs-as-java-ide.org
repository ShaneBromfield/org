* JDEE
seems stagnant
* malabar-mode with autocomplete
*** recommend you to use malabar-mode instead of JDEE - malabar is the only modern mode for Java development currently available for Emacs. It offers:
*** Tight integration with Maven
*** A Groovy console for rapid prototyping and exploratory programming
*** JUnit integration, both for running tests standalone and through Maven
*** Import help; import one class or all needed classes in the buffer (with prompting if the class name is ambiguous)
*** Extend class / implement interface / override method helpers
*** Simplistic refactorings
