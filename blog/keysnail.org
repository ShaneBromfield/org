As I already explains, I'm a feedback addict.
I want to know if:
- what I'm doing is right fast
- have feedback immediately after I ask for something

why?

Because ideas are as fast as poping out of nowhere as disappearing into nowhere...

Sometimes, it's right to think and think and think again and go implementing...

And sometimes, it's better to go and tinker...
