* DONE Core features [3/3]
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:38]
** DONE Facts and prerequisites: How you describe claims about your code.
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:29]
** DONE Extended equality: `=` extended for regular expressions, functions, etc.
CLOSED: [2011-10-15 sam. 07:29]
** DONE Checkers: Prepackaged functions that perform common checks.
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:29]
* TODO Other features [1/3]
** DONE More about facts [3/3]
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:45]
*** DONE Negating arrows: A convenient way to describe what’s not true.
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:39]
*** DONE Future facts: “Commenting out” facts in a way that prevents you from forgetting about them.
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:41]
*** DONE Tabular facts: Shorthand for checking multiple sets of values
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:45]
** TODO More about checkers [0/3]
*** TODO Checkers for collections and strings: Containment checking that allows gaps, arbitrary ordering, nested checkers, etc.
      o Chatty checkers: Checkers that explain more about a failure.
      o Checkers within prerequisites They’re treated slightly differently than the normal case.
*** TODO Metaconstants: A notation that avoids confusion between what’s essential about data and what’s accidental.
*** TODO Metaconstants as partial packets of values
** TODO More about prerequisites [0/6]
*** TODO Folded prerequisites: Allowing prerequisites like `(f (g 1)) => 2`.
*** TODO Background prerequisites: Prerequisites that apply to more than one fact.
*** TODO Using stateful functions as prerequisites
*** TODO Specifying call counts: Saying the function-under-test calls another function N times.
*** TODO Checkers within prerequisites: They’re treated slightly differently than the normal case.
*** TODO Prerequisites and protocols: Extra work is required to override protocol functions in facts. [0/2]
***** TODO Setup, teardown, and state: Executing code before, after, and around multiple facts or individual checks.
***** TODO Production mode: Preventing Midje code from being compiled into production code.
* TODO Integration and migration [0/7]
** TODO Migrating from clojure.test
** TODO lein test: It works with Midje.
** TODO lein midje: It works better.
** TODO cake midje: There’s a Cake task for Midje.
** TODO Midje-mode: Emacs mode for using Midje with a REPL.
** TODO clojure-jump-to-file: Jump to a line of Clojure code from any Emacs buffer (usually a shell buffer).
** TODO Cascalog functions
* TODO Videos [1/4]
** DONE An introduction to Midje for clojure.test users
CLOSED: [2011-10-14 ven. 07:32]
** TODO An example showing top-down testing using metaconstants (alternate download)
** TODO An Emacs minor mode for Midje
** TODO Emacs code to jump to a particular location in a Clojure file
* TODO Project [0/4]
** TODO Roadmap
** TODO Help wanted
** TODO Error message improvements
** TODO Why is it called "Midje"?
* TODO Tips [0/4]
** TODO Caching: Checking memoization and caching.
** TODO Top-down testing: “Programming by wishful thinking”
** TODO More than one check per checker
** TODO Line numbers in helper functions
