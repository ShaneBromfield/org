To override the default bindings, here are some important files:

/usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-2.0-key/gtkrc
/usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-3.0/gtk-keys.css

* gtk2

Now to get inspired and adapt, we can either create a ~/.gtkrc-2.0 for the gtk2 applications.
#+begin_src sh
# font
gtk-font-name = "DejaVu Sans Mono 10"

# emacs bindings in chat window
gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"

# override some default bindings
binding "my-pidgin-bindings"
{
    bind "<ctrl>i" { "insert-at-cursor" ("\t") }
    bind "<ctrl>j" { "insert-at-cursor" ("\n") }
    bind "Return" { "message_send" () }
    bind "<ctrl>m" { "message_send" () }
}
widget "*pidgin_conv_entry" binding "my-pidgin-bindings"

# This lets you edit your Pidgin key bindings from within Pidgin,
# by hovering over a menu item and hitting a key combo.
# gtk-can-change-accels = 1
#+end_src

* gtk3

Or create a ~/.themes/Emacs/ which will certainly complement the main one.
