#+STARTUP: indent
#+STARTUP: hidestars

I have got some troubles with my network from some time now.
So here is one solution my team and I think of to overcome it.

We created a [[http://vagrantup.com/][vagrant machine]] with [[http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/polipo/polipo.html][polipo]] inside.

* Install
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo aptitude install polipo
#+END_SRC

* Make it a service
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo aptitude install chkconfig
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo chkconfig polipo on
#+END_SRC
* Setup
Here is the setup

** Open the proxy to clients

We permit remote connections to the proxy.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
proxyAddress=0.0.0.0
#+END_SRC

*Note*
No access restriction is done yet.

* Restart
At the end of the setup, restart the service.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo service polipo restart
#+END_SRC
