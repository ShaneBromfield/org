* keywords
confidentiality
integrity
* crypto is everywhere
** web traffic -> https (SSL/TLS)
** wireless -> 802.11i wpa2, bluetooth
** protecting file on disk
** dvd -> Content Scrambling System
** blu-ray -> AACS
** user authentication
* public key crypto
* protecting file
metaphor about files: store a file is like sending a message to oneself in the future
* symmetric encryption
E(k, m) = c

D(k, c) = m

E encrypting
D decrypting
k key
m message
c cipher

All encryption algorithms are publicly known!
The only secret is the key!

Note: Never use a proprietary encryption algorithm

* Use cases
** single use -> to encrypt only one message (for email for example)
** multiple use -> to encrypt file system
