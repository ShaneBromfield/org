* Just me

[[../img/tux-clj.png]]

* Personally
I'm a free software fan boy geek (GNU/Linux, GNU/Emacs, *BSD, Android and Free Software etc...).
Also, completely development addict (Clojure, Haskell, JVM, C, Nix, *sh, etc...)

I'm /trying/ to share the computer knowledge I have with the rest of the world.

*Why?* Because I have this completely and utterly utopist dream of free knowledge (as in free beer).

/Trying to share/ when i'm not too busy playing with my kids or coding
to solve some problems ([[http://projecteuler.net][Project Euler]],[[http://4clojure.com][ 4clojure.com]]) or playing some guitar
or losing my precious time in some bull... means of transportation.

Anyway, here is my rapid resume.

* Rapid resume
** Once upon a time, I was a student
Master's degree in Networks and systems at the [[http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/][Denis Diderot College Paris VII]].
** Then I started working
Software engineer for 4,5 years at [[http://www.sopragroup.com"][Sopra Group]].
Now I continue developing software [[http://www.sfeir.com/][@Sfeir]] (for 3.5 years now).
Some legacy technologies I came across : JEE4/5, PHP4/5, Oracle, Hibernate, Spring, etc...
** Now
I'm a developer/devops.
I have been working with [[http://www.sfeir.com/][Sfeir]] for at least 3.5 years now.
The technologies are more recent: JVM, Java, Scala, Hadoop, Zookeeper, AngularJS, Puppet, ...

Some more advanced technologies I came across during my spare time: Haskell, *Lisp (Emacs-Lisp, Common-Lisp, Clojure, Scheme, ...), Nixos, Purescript, Android, Angularjs, Nodejs, Chef, Pallet, Docker, Vagrant, etc..
