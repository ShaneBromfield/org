* Just me

[[./resources/tux-clj.png]]

* Personally
I'm just a linux fan boy geek (GNU/Linux, *BSD, Android and Free Software etc...).
Also, completely development addict (Clojure, Haskell, Java, C, PHP, *sh, Perl, Python, etc...)

I'm /trying/ to share the little computer knowledge I have with the rest of the
world.

*Why?* Because I have this completely amazingly and utterly utopist dream of free knowledge (as in free beer).

/Trying to share/ when i'm not too busy playing with my kids or coding
to solve some problems ([[http://projecteuler.net][Project Euler]],[[http://4clojure.com][ 4clojure.com]]) or playing guitar (then again trying)
or losing my precious time in some bull... means of transportation.

Anyway, here is my rapid resume.
* Rapid resume
** Once upon a time, i was a student
Master's degree in Networks and systems at the [[http://www.univ-paris-diderot.fr/][Denis Diderot College Paris VII]].
** Then i started working
Software engineer for 4 years at [[http://www.sopragroup.com"][Sopra Group]].
Some technologies i came across : JEE4/5, PHP4/5, Oracle, Hibernate, Spring, Ant, Maven, etc...
** Now
I'm still a software engineer but i like to call it simply developer as i really really enjoy coding.
I'm working with [[http://www.sfeir.com/][Sfeir]].
The technologies are innovative : GWT, Android, NoSQL, etc...
