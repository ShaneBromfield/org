** Choosing acoutic or electric guitar
To help choose:
- influenced or inspired by the artist's instrument
- acoustic physically slightly harder
- acoustic is a complete package though
- electric guitar needs other tools: amplifier, cable, tuner, etc...
** Choosing the right guitar right-handed vs left-handed
- professional quality (good working part, stay in tuned)
- love your instrument (esthetic, cosmetic, etc...)
- do not sacrifice the quality for the estetic
- Left or right?
** Parts of the guitar (electric and acoustic)
*** electric (strato)
- strings
- (locking) tuners
- nut (~chevalet)
- frets (often there are markers to the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th frets etc...)
- sadle (for intonation)
- wammy bar (tremolo)
- input (where you plug the guitar cable)
- pickups (micro?)
- pickup selector switch (darker, brighter, lighter sound) - select the pickup or pickups depending on the position
- coil (the micro on the pickup?)
- controls (tone, volume)
- truss-rode adjustment area (hole at the top of the neck of the guitar) -> control the bow and in effect the height of the string above the fretboard.
- pickguard (cover and protect the guitar)
** Essential accessories for acoustic guitar
- case (to protect your instrument)
- guitar strap
- extra strings
- metronome
- electric pickup (mic')
- tuner (permanent, onboard, head-stock, etc...)
- a string winder (to help retune rapidly the string)
- humidifier
- capo (~ movable nut) - play any open position chords on your fretboard
** Essential accessories for electric guitar
- case (gig bag, soft)
- guitar cable (transmit the sound from the guitar's pickup to the amplifier) - good quality is important
- strap lock (to avoid the strap to slip and you drop the guitar)
- extra strings
- tuner
- metronome
- guitar pick (a lot)

- chord block -> partial view to concentrate on the chord
