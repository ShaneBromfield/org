** Choosing acoutic or electric guitar
To help choose:
- influenced or inspired by the artist's instrument
- acoustic physically slightly harder
- acoustic is a complete package though
- electric guitar needs other tools: amplifier, cable, tuner, etc...
** Choosing the right guitar right-handed vs left-handed
- professional quality (good working part, stay in tuned)
- love your instrument (esthetic, cosmetic, etc...)
- do not sacrifice the quality for the estetic
- Left or right?
** Parts of the guitar (electric and acoustic)
*** electric (strato)
- strings
- (locking) tuners
- nut (~chevalet)
- frets (often there are markers to the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th frets etc...)
- sadle (for intonation)
- wammy bar (tremolo)
- input (where you plug the guitar cable)
- pickups (micro?)
- pickup selector switch (darker, brighter, lighter sound) - select the pickup or pickups depending on the position
- coil (the micro on the pickup?)
- controls (tone, volume)
- truss-rode adjustment area (hole at the top of the neck of the guitar) -> control the bow and in effect the height of the string above the fretboard.
- pickguard (cover and protect the guitar)
** Essential accessories for acoustic guitar
- case (to protect your instrument)
- guitar strap
- extra strings
- metronome
- electric pickup (mic')
- tuner (permanent, onboard, head-stock, etc...)
- a string winder (to help retune rapidly the string)
- humidifier
- capo (~ movable nut) - play any open position chords on your fretboard
** Essential accessories for electric guitar
- case (gig bag, soft)
- guitar cable (transmit the sound from the guitar's pickup to the amplifier) - good quality is important
- strap lock (to avoid the strap to slip and you drop the guitar)
- extra strings
- tuner
- metronome
- guitar pick (a lot)

** Chord block diagrams and fretboard maps
- chord block -> partial view to concentrate on the chord
- fretboard map -> full view of the fretboard

- fret in harmonics
E (6) + A (5)'s 5th frets, fret and check against the 7th fret of the A (5) + D (4)

** DONE Picking techniques
CLOSED: [2013-08-02 ven. 19:35]
- heavy/light/medium pick
- pick determine the tone you end up with
- different ways to use pick
- picking techniques:
  - use metronome (60 bpm to start) and down stroke in rythm
  - down stroke (6 -> 1; 1 -> 6)
  - up stroke
  - alternate picking - 2 notes (down, up)
  - alternate picking - 3 notes per string (down, up, down) and keep the current stroke to the next
  - alternate picking - 4 notes per string

** DONE Finger Picking
CLOSED: [2013-08-02 ven. 19:45]
*** Fundamental finger style
- thumb         - cover 3 basses 6-5-4 strings
- ring finger   - E 1
- middle finger - B 2
- index finger  - G 3
exercise:
- nothing else matters beginning
- same but thumb cover each bass after the 3 string are fretted
- same exercise with metronome

*** Alternate finger picking
alternate between index and second finger on the same string
*** Exercise
- Am - twice
- E  - twice
- finger picking as describe early
** DONE Strumming the guitar

CLOSED: [2013-08-03 sam. 09:26]
- In western music, we have 12 half steps
- In the guitar, each step correspond to a fret
- 12 half steps higher on another E (same in another octave) ->
- ladder name corresponds to a step (A, B, ...)
