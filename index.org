Welcome to my blog.

I am @ardumont on [[https://github.com/ardumont][github]] and [[https://twitter.com/ardumont][twitter]].

I develop software and contribute to multiple [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][free/libre ones]] on my spare time.

Here you will find my notes on multiple subjects that I came across at some point.

Sometimes, these are:
- notes
- articles
- to reproduce some advanced automation I keep forgetting.

With a little luck, this could help others too.
