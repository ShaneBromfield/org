I am Antoine R. Dumont, a developer, @ardumont on [[https://github.com/ardumont][github]] and [[https://twitter.com/ardumont][twitter]].

I develop software and contribute to multiple free ones on my spare time.

Here you will find my notes on multiple subjects that I came across at some point.
Sometimes, it's just notes, sometimes it's articles and sometimes, it's to permit myself to reproduce some advanced automation I keep forgetting.

With a little luck, this could help others too.
