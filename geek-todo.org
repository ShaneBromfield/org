** DONE How to add some keywords (FAIL, PENDING, etc...)
CLOSED: [2012-04-21 Sat 12:29]
2 solutions:
- per file:
Add a line at the beginning of the file like this
#+begin_src org
\#+TODO: TODO PENDING | FAIL DONE DELEGATED CANCELLED
#+end_src
then =C-c C-c= to reload the file in org-mode.

[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Per_002dfile-keywords.html]]

- global to org-mode:

Add this to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "PENDING" "|" "DONE" "FAIL" "DELEGATED" "CANCELLED")))
#+end_src

** DONE Add this in the emacs setup.

Add an input table.
#+tblname: fibonacci-inputs
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |

Create a block of code that takes the previous table as input
#+name: fibonacci-seq(fib-inputs=fibonacci-inputs)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun fibonacci (n)
    (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1))
        n
      (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
  
  (mapcar (lambda (row)
            (mapcar #'fibonacci row)) fib-inputs)
#+end_src

*Note*:
=C-c C-o= will open another buffer with the result in it.

Hit =C-c C-c= to launch the evaluationm and then, this result table is generated
#+RESULTS: fibonacci-seq
| 1 | 1 | 2 |  3 |  5 |   8 |  13 |  21 |   34 |   55 |
| 1 | 3 | 8 | 21 | 55 | 144 | 377 | 987 | 2584 | 6765 |

Add this to the init.el

This basically tells, when org-mode launches, deactivate the linum-mode (which on my setup is globally activated)
