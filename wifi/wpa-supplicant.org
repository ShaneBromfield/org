#+title: nixos + wifi network
#+author: ardumont

When starting from nixos, you need a network.
The KDE UI does not provide anything (or at least, I did not find anything).

As usual, CLI to the rescue, use `wpa_passphrase`.

#+begin_src sh
wpa_passphrase <your-ssid>
#+end_src

This will ask you your passphrase.
And output something along those line:

#+begin_src text
network={
  ssid="<your-ssid>"
  #psk="<your-pass-in-clear>"
  psk=<your-encrypted-pass>
}
#+end_src

So:

#+begin_src sh
wpa_passphrase your-ssid >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
#+end_src

Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and remove your clear pass.

Then restart the network service.

#+begin_src sh
systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.service
#+end_src

Then, check that you successfully connected to your network.

#+begin_src sh
ifconfig
#+end_src

That's it.
