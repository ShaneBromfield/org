Redundant Array of Independent Disks
Software and Hardware (direclty on mother board, or raid controller)

* Raid 0

Block/bit/byte level striping (disks head write at the same time contiguous data)
no parity
no mirroring

** Pros-cons

| the more the disks, the faster the writing goes. | the more the disks the more likely the loss of data |
|--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|

** Recovery

none

** Use case

- performance

* Raid 1

Mirroring
no stripping
no parity

** Pros/cons

- mirrored with no parity nor striping
- as fast as the slower disk (so better to have the same hdd specs)
n- at least 2 disks

|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pros           | Cons                                                                             |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| redundancy     | not full storage (half the space is used for storage, the other half for backup) |
| fault tolerant |                                                                                  |
| not slow       | not fast                                                                         |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1/n space is used for storage

*tips*
Avoid buying the disks from the same place at the same time.

** Recovery

Add a new disk with the same spec as before.
The data will be recovered with copy/paste actions (fast).

** Use case

- for example, only 2 hdd
- need to have a working environment (not distraught by the loss of hdd)
- important data to backup

* Raid 5

Block level striping (write contiguous data to each disk simultaneously) with distributed parity (parity sum is written on each disk alternatively)

- at least 3 disks
- Use n-1's capacity storage

** Pros/cons

|-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pros                                    | Cons                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fast                                    | slower if one hdd is dead (the data is built back using the parity to show the data) |
| use n-1 full storage (minus the parity) | lose 1 disk (for parity)                                                             |
| one hdd fault tolerance                 |                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

*tips*
Use lots of smaller disks to reduce the storage loss (due to the parity).

With 2 disks of 1T, we lose 1T of storage.
With 10 disks of 200G, we lose only 200G of storage.

** Recovery

Add a new disk.
The data is rebuilt from computing the lost data out of the parity.
It's slow. The larger the raid, the slower the recovery.

** Use case

High availability system

* Raid 6

Block level striping with doubled-distributed parity.

- at least 3 disks.

|--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pros                     | Cons                                                                          |
|--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fast                     | slower if hdd dies (the data is built back using the parity to show the data) |
| use n-2's disks capacity | lose 2 disks (for parity and the parity's parity's sakes)                     |
| 2 hdd fault tolerance    |                                                                               |

With 10 disks of 200G, we lose only 200G of storage.

Add the missing disks.

It's slow. The larger the raid, the slower the recovery.

* Raid 10
Mirroring and striping

mirroring
no parity

** Pros/cons

|----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| Pros                             | Cons                                                |
|----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| fault tolerance (through mirror) | if we lose the mirrorred disk, we lose all the data |
| stripping                        | only use 50 percent of the storage space            |
|----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------|

* Definitions

- striping: write contiguous data (sliced as block/bit/byte) to each raid's disk (as a consequence, it's fast). Raid Disks's heads write at the same time.
- parity: compute the contiguous data written to each disk and compute a hash (compression algo)
- high availability: up all the times
