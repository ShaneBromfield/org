* Object
** Unit of measure: Class
*** What does this mean?
**** Instanciation policy...
Framework like guice or spring for dependency injection
**** Stateful code
**** Design Pattern
Really?
intertwined?
complect?
anyone?
**** tests
How do i test:
- static method?
- stateful method?
**** feedback
To have feedback, tests are mandatory or else...

Nightmare/Hell
** Data as object
*** mutable
concurrency anyone?
volatile, synchronized, really?
*** Why?
state and identity are 2 different things.
why merge it?
* Imagine
** No instanciation of class
** stateless
** instant feedback
** Immutability
** No encapsulation
* Clojure
** Unit of measure: function
*** What does this mean?
**** no instanciation
**** stateless
**** immediate feedback
**** (tests are optionals)
** Data as Data
*** a list is a list
*** if object need be, why not a map?
*** unicity? set?
** oh! and code is data
