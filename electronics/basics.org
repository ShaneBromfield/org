like charges repel
opposite charge attract

Coulomb: unit of charge

atom composed of protons/neutrons/electrons

e = Charge of proton
-e = Charge of electron

1C = 6.24 x 10^18 e

Coulomb figured out that:
Fe = Kq1.q2 / d^2

d: distance between objects
K = 9.10^9 N.m^2/C^2

looks like the gravitation law:
Fe = Gm1.m2 / d^2
