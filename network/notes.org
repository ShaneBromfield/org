#+title: Notes on network setup

* Resolver configuration file

/etc/resolv.conf is managed through network manager (at least in debian and in nixos, it's also possible to use it)

Local resolver configuration file - (cf. `man resolv.conf`)

To ease shortname lookup, use the `search` directive:
search <some-domain0> <some-other-domain>...

Make the resolv.conf persistent:
#+begin_src sh
nmcli con mod <conn-name> +ipv4.dns-search <some-other-domain>
#+end_src

Add dns:
#+begin_src sh
nmcli con mod <conn-name> +ipv4.dns <some-dns-ip>
#+end_src

* DNS

When you have to setup some other dns, you have by default the gateway which adds itself

Remove this option:
#+begin_src sh
nmcli con mod <conn-name> +ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
#+end_src

* Apply modifications

Then restart the network-manager service to check the persistence:
#+begin_src sh
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
#+end_src
