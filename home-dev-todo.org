including org)

** DONE How to add some keywords (FAIL, PENDING, etc...)
CLOSED: [2012-04-21 Sat 12:29]
2 solutions:
- per file:
Add a line at the beginning of the file like this
#+begin_src org
\#+TODO: TODO FAIL PENDING | DONE DELEGATED CANCELLED
#+end_src
then =C-c C-c= to reload the file in org-mode.

[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Per_002dfile-keywords.html]]

- global to org-mode:

Add this to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "FAIL" "PENDING" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED" "CANCELLED")))
#+end_src

** DONE How to inactivate the linum-mode in org-mode?
CLOSED: [2012-04-21 Sat 12:41]
Add this to the init.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda () (setq linum-mode nil)))
#+end_src

This basically tells, when org-mode launches, deactivate the linum-mode (which on my setup is globally activated)
