#+title: install debian

I already have a nixos install.
Unfortunately, debian did not see it.
I installed the bootloader inside the key to avoid overwriting the one from nixos.

Still here the message that could help someday:
#+begin_src txt
you will need to boot manually with the /vmlinuz kernel on partition /dev/sda1 and `root=/dev/sda1 quite persistent` passed as a kernel argument
#+end_src
