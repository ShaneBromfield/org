#+title: fix fracking authorization required in nas synology

To activate quickconnect or ddns

from: http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?t=92484&start=30

SSH or telnet

nas> /usr/syno/sbin/synocloudserviceauth -a get

gives an application key like this:
xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx

nas> /usr/syno/sbin/synocloudserviceauth -a validate

gives the following:
failed to validate a api key

remove the application_key.conf file in /etc/ (you can copy the file first or rename it if you want a backup)

nas> rm /etc/application_key.conf

Get new application key?!

DiskStation> /usr/syno/sbin/synocloudserviceauth -a get -f

gives an application key like this but this time is has changed from last time:
xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx

DiskStation> /usr/syno/sbin/synocloudserviceauth -a validate

now gives the new application key instead of the failed to validate a api key error :
xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx

Support told me this is an error at their end and there still investigating. However my problem is solved.

Hope this helped.
